# Battleship
A real-time [battleship game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>) (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle) for pairs of players, built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

The project is built on [create-react-app-example](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-example) of [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).
The example is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Game

Each player has a 10x10 board on which the player is able to place 5 ships:

- A Carrier, which is 5 tiles long
- A Battleship, which is 4 tiles long
- A Cruiser, which is 3 tiles long
- A Submarine, which is 3 tiles long
- A Destroyer, which is 2 tiles long

Each ship can be placed either horizontally or vertically on the board, and cannot be placed partially off the board.

Each tile is denoted by a coordinate, A-J for columns and 1-10 for rows.

Each player then takes turns picking a tile on the opposing playerâ€™s grid, taking a shot at that tile.

- If the tile contains a ship, the shot is a HIT
- If the tile does not contain a ship, the shot is a MISS.

A ship is sunk if all the tiles for that ship have been marked as a HIT.

The game ends when one player has sunk all of the opposing players ships.
